This project implements a simple linear regression model in C++ to predict house prices based on a given dataset. 
Linear regression is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning that aims to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. 
In this case, we use it to predict house prices based on features such as the size of the house.
